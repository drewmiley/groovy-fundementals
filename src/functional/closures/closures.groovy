/*
    A closure is an open, anonymous block of code that can take arguments, return a value and be assigned to a variable

    A closure may reference variables declared in its surrounding scope.

    In opposition to the formal definition of a closure, a closure in Groovy can also contain free variables which are
    defined outside of its surrounding scope.
